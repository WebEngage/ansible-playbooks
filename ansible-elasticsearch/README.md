# Elasticsearch


Ansible role to install Elasticsearch on Debian (Ubuntu) and Enterprise Linux (RedHat, CentOS) systems, with full configuration capabilities. This role uses the [official packages](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-repositories.html) from Elastic. It will also work on Fedora and Amazon Linux.

### Features

* Install any version of Elasticsearch that is available in the official repositories
* Fully configure Elasticsearch settings through variables
* Wait for Elasticsearch to be listening for connections before continuing with play
* Install plugins


## Requirements
Java 7 or higher, as specified in the [Elasticsearch manual](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html#jvm-version). This role does not install Java; you may use your preferred role to install a suitable Java JRE on all Elasticsearch hosts. Include the role ansible-oracle-java

## Role Variables

This role allows you to fully configure Elasticsearch using variables. Besides variables that control the behavior of the role, variables can also be set in `/etc/default/elasticsearch` and `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

These variables control the behavior of the role:

* `es_release`: The release of Elasticsearch to install (default: `"1.7"`).
* `es_version`: The version of Elasticsearch to install (default: `"1.7.1"`).
* `es_wait_for_listen`: If set to true, whenever Elasticsearch is restarted, the playbook will wait for Elasticsearch to respond on port `es_etc_http_port` (default: `9200`) before proceeding (default: `"yes"`).

### /etc/default/elasticsearch

Variables in `/etc/default/elasticsearch` begin with `es_default_`. For example:

```yaml
---
es_default_es_user: es
es_default_es_group: es
```

will result in these lines in `/etc/default/elasticsearch`:

```ini
ES_USER=es
ES_GROUP=es
```

The full list of variables is in `templates/elasticsearch`. Custom variables not in the list can also be set by passing a dictionary called `es_default`, whose keys are variable names. For example, these variables:

```yaml
---
es_default:
  HELLO: world
  CUSTOM: variable
```

will produce:

```ini
HELLO=world
CUSTOM=variable
```

### /etc/elasticesarch/elasticsearch.yml

Similarly, the variables in `/etc/elasticesarch/elasticsearch.yml` can be fully configured by declaring variables starting with `es_etc_`. As before, you can look up the full list of variables in `templates/elasticsearch.yml`, and any variables not in that list can also be set through a dictionary `es_etc`. This is useful, for example, for setting obscure variables documented in the Elasticsearch reference manual, or variables for custom modules.

This example:

```yaml
---
es_etc_cluster_name: test_cluster
es_etc_index_number_of_shards: 3
es_etc:
  http.max_header_size: 16kB
  transport.tcp.connect_timeout: 20s
```

will produce these lines in `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`:

```yaml
cluster.name: test_cluster
index.number_of_shards: 3
http.max_header_size: 16kB
transport.tcp.connect_timeout: 20s
```

## Plugins

To install plugins, set the `es_plugins` variable to the list of plugins to be installed, specifying the name, and optionally, the URL to download the plugin from, and the file to check if the plugin has been installed.

The simplest way to install plugins is to specify the name of the plugin:

```yaml
---
es_plugins:
  - name: elasticsearch/marvel
```

The version to install may also be specified:

```yaml
---
es_plugins:
  - name: elasticsearch/marvel/1.3.1
```

Some plugins need to be downloaded from a custom URL:

```yaml
---
es_plugins:
  - name: elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1
    url: https://oss-es-plugins.s3.amazonaws.com/elasticsearch-jetty/elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1.zip
```

The plugins will only be installed if `plugin_file` cannot be found. If not specified, then `plugin_file` will be the second component of the plugin `name` (i.e., after the first forward slash):

```yaml
---
es_plugins:
  # Will skip installation if /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/marvel directory exists
  - name: elasticsearch/marvel/1.3.1
```

The example above does not check if the specific version of the plugin is installed, only that *some* version of it is. To make Ansible skip installation only if the specific version is installed, specify the path of the specific file to look for:

```yaml
---
es_plugins:
  # Will skip installation if /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/marvel/marvel-1.3.1.jar exists
  - name: elasticsearch/marvel/1.3.1
    plugin_file: marvel/marvel-1.3.1.jar
```

Unfortunately, this role cannot automatically determine the filename to check for, since naming conventions are inconsistent between plugins. Take these three plugins for example:

```yaml
---
es_plugins:
  # <plugin name>/<plugin name>-<plugin version>.jar
  - name: elasticsearch/marvel/1.3.1
    plugin_file: marvel/marvel-1.3.1.jar
  # <plugin name>/ (no specific jar file, as this is a site plugin)
  - name: lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf/v1.5.4
    plugin_file: kopf
  # <plugin name>-<plugin version>/elasticsearch-<plugin name>-<plugin version>.jar
  - name: elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1
    url: https://oss-es-plugins.s3.amazonaws.com/elasticsearch-jetty/elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1.zip
    plugin_file: jetty-1.2.1/elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1.jar
```

## Example Playbook

```yaml
---
# Assume all nodes already have Java installed

# Master nodes
- hosts: elasticsearch_master
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      es_default_heap_size: 8g
      es_etc_cluster_name: my_cluster
      es_etc_node_master: true
      es_etc_node_data: false
      es_plugins:
        - name: elasticsearch/marvel/1.3.1
          plugin_file: marvel/marvel-1.3.1.jar
        - name: elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1
          url: https://oss-es-plugins.s3.amazonaws.com/elasticsearch-jetty/elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1.zip
          plugin_file: jetty-1.2.1/elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1.jar

# Data nodes
- hosts: elasticsearch_data
  roles:
    - role: elasticsearch
      es_default_heap_size: 16g
      es_etc_cluster_name: my_cluster
      es_etc_node_master: false
      es_etc_node_data: true
        - name: elasticsearch/marvel/1.3.1
          plugin_file: marvel/marvel-1.3.1.jar
        - name: elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1
          url: https://oss-es-plugins.s3.amazonaws.com/elasticsearch-jetty/elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1.zip
          plugin_file: jetty-1.2.1/elasticsearch-jetty-1.2.1.jar
```
